# CryptoClustering
<h1>Analysis of Cryptocurrency</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2><br>
<h3>Find Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame</h3><br>
<p> The best value for k would be 4, according to this dataset</p>

<h3>Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using Original Scaled Data</h3><br>
<p></p>

<h3>Optimize clusters with Principal Component Analysis</h3><br>
<p>Using the three principal components, the totla explained variance is: .369, .292, and .229</p>

<h3>Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data</h3><br>
<p>Using the PCA data the best value for k is still 4 </p>

<h3>Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data</h3><br>
<p>After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-means is as follows. Using fewer results means we lose a bit of the data, which will decrease accuracy. The loss in data can cause less well-defined results. We may even get bias towards one figure over another, which would naturally skew the results.</p>
